%
% \documentclass{woosterthesis} must be at the beginning of every IS. Options are the same as
% for the report class with some additional options, abstractonly, blacklinks, code, kaukecopyright, palatino, picins,
% maple, index, verbatim, dropcaps, euler, gauss, alltt,  woolshort, colophon, woosterchicago, and
% achemso. The kaukecopyright option will put the arch symbol with the word mark on the
% copyright page. The woosterthesis class is based on the report class. One thing to note is that
% the ``%'' symbol comments out all characters that follow it on the line.

%  There will be certain commands that you use frequently in the thesis. You can give these
%  commands new names which are easier for you to remember. You can also combine several
%  commands into a new command of your own. See The LaTeX Companion or Guide to LaTeX
%  for examples on defining your own commands. These are commands that I defined to cut
%  down on typing. You can enter your commands in the personal.tex file in the styles folder.
